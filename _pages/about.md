I am a lecturer (assistant professor) at the Adam Smith Business School at the University of Glasgow. I work in Labor Economics with a focus on the Economics of Crime. I am also a research affiliate at [CESifo](https://www.cesifo.org/en) and [IZA](https://www.iza.org/).

[**The Impact of an Early Career Shock on Intergenerational Mobility**](/assets/docs/KNR_Job_Loss_Intergenerational_Mobility_Revision.pdf) with [Emily Nix](https://sites.google.com/site/emilyenix/) and [Krista Riukula](https://sites.google.com/view/kristariukula/) <span style="font-size:15px"> **Journal of Labor Economics**, *Vol. 43 Number 4 (October 2025)* </span>

Children's and parent's incomes are highly correlated, yet little is known about how early career shocks contribute to this correlation. This paper focuses on a consequential labor market shock: job loss. We document three new results. First,
adult children born into the bottom 20% of the income distribution have double the unemployment following job loss compared with those from the top 20%, and 154% higher earnings losses. Second, this increases the rank-rank correlation 30% for those impacted. Third, richer parents provide career opportunities to their adult children after
job loss, consistent with advantages from wealthy parents persisting well into adulthood.

This paper studies the impact of income-based criminal punishments on crime. In Finland, speeding tickets become income-dependent if the driver's speed exceeds the speeding limit by more than 20 km/h, leading to a substantial jump in the size of the speeding ticket. Contrary to predictions of a traditional Becker model, individuals do not bunch below the fine hike. Instead, the speeding distributions are smooth at the cutoff. However, I demonstrate that the size of the realized speeding ticket has sizable but short-lived impacts on reoffending ex-post. I use a regression discontinuity design to show that fines that are 200 euros larger decrease reoffending by 15 percent in the following six months. After 12 months, the effect disappears. My empirical results are consistent with an explanation that people operate under information frictions. To illustrate this, I construct a Becker model with misperception and learning that can explain all the empirical findings.

[**Punishing Financial Crimes: The Impact of Prison Sentences on Defendants and Their Colleagues**](/assets/docs/Financial_Crime_and_Spillovers.pdf) with [Kristiina Huttunen](https://sites.google.com/site/krhuttunen/), [Dave Macdonald](https://sites.google.com/view/dave-mac/home) and [Emily Nix](https://sites.google.com/site/emilyenix/) <span style="font-size:15px"> **Revise & Resubmit American Economic Journal: Economic Policy** </span> 

<span style="font-size:15px">
Financial crimes are prolific and impose significant costs on societies. In this paper, we investigate whether prison sentences reduce financial crimes. Using random assignment of judges to identify causal impacts of prison sentences from 2000 to 2018 in Finland, we show that prison reduces defendant re-offending by 42.9 percentage points in the three years following the crime. We also find that a prison sentence reduces colleagues' propensity to commit financial crimes in the future, suggesting important spillover effects of harsher punishments.

[**The Crime Ladder: Estimating the Impact of Different Punishments on Defendant Outcomes**](/assets/docs/ladder.pdf) with [Kristiina Huttunen](https://sites.google.com/site/krhuttunen/) and [Emily Nix](https://sites.google.com/site/emilyenix/)

<span style="font-size:15px">
  Most criminal justice systems use a "ladder of punishments" that starts with less severe punishments and progress to more severe punishments according to crime severity and criminal history. Using random assignment to judges, we estimate causal impacts of three common punishments on the ladder-fines, probation, and prison-on defendants' criminal and labor market outcomes. We find that fines increase recidivism. However, this increase is concentrated among those committing less severe crimes. Probation decreases recidivism for those committing less severe crimes and first offenders. Neither fines nor probation affect earnings. Prison has a mixed impact, decreasing future charges but also decreasing earnings.
